# Blogger: An all-in-one blogging platform

Blogger is your all-in-one blogging platform framework built in **Next.js** and **Shadcn/ui**, making it easy for you to manage your own blog. It features markdown-first blog post editing, user commenting (very soon), open-sourced APIs, and expansive configuration options.

## Quick start

Run the following to get a development instance running.
