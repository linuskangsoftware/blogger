# Privacy Policy for Blogger Online Services

**Effective Date:** 13/07/2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Blogger Online Services ("BOS") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our services.

## 1. What Information We Collect

BOS does not collect or store personal data. The only information temporarily accessed is the public IP address of users submitting comments via integrated blogs. This IP is determined based on standard headers such as:

- ``cf-connecting-ip``

- ``x-forwarded-for``

- ``x-real-ip``

The IP address is immediately returned to the blog owner's client and is not stored, logged, or processed further.

## 2. How We Use IP Addresses

The returned IP addresses are:

- Used only for blog comment moderation by the blog owner.

- Not linked to any user account or personally identifiable information.

## 3. No Data Retention

BOS does not store logs or persist any IP-related data. The service is stateless and ephemeral.

## 4. Opt-Out Options

Blog owners have full control over whether BOS is used. They may:

- Set ``IP_FETCH_URL=none`` to disable IP tracking entirely.

- Use their own IP-fetching endpoint to retain complete control.

Additionally, disabling BOS does not remove any essential blogger features. It is solely a extra provided service to track visitor comments.

## 5. Third Parties

BOS does not share data with third parties, and never will. All data interactions occur between the blog owner and their users. BOS only acts as a facilitator for returning IP headers.

## 6. Cookies and Tracking

BOS does not use cookies, session storage, local storage, fingerprinting, or any client-side tracking methods.

## 7. Security

Although BOS does not store data, we implement best practices to protect the infrastructure and prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This means that if we find suspicious activity, we will flag your IP address along with any other useful information for review.

## 8. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted and marked with a new effective date. Additionally, we will notify Blogger Blog Owners who are inside the official [Linus Kang Software Discord](https://linus.id.au/ds).

## 9. Data Deletion Requests

BOS does not store or retain any user data. If you wish to delete data related to you, please contact the blog owner whose site you interacted with. They are responsible for any data they collect using BOS.

## 10. Contact
